# Problem Statement
The rise of urbanization and the increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation have resulted in the widespread adoption of bike-sharing systems in numerous cities across the globe. However, the current problem lies in the inadequate availability of bikes at different stations, which often fails to meet the demand and consequently leads to customer dissatisfaction. In order to tackle this issue, the primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately forecasting the demand for bike rentals based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week. By accurately predicting the demand, bike-sharing companies can effectively manage their inventory, ensuring an ample number of bikes are accessible at high-demand locations and times. This, in turn, will enhance customer satisfaction and optimize revenue generation.
